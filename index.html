                        New Orleans is the closest place to me geographically that feels like magic. 
                        My favorite time of the year to go is the earliest whisper of spring. It is a 
                        way to get a preview of the beauty to come with the blooming flowers everywhere 
                        and the optimism that fills the air after what always feels like a desperate end 
                        to winter in St. Louis. Jazz lines the streets of the French Quarter and Frenchman 
                        and there is so much to experience as far as food, cocktails, and sights - 
                        it really wakes up all of my senses. It’s not all fun and magic, with its rich 
                        history of slavery and oppression - I would definitely recommend checking out an 
                        alternative history tour, the pharmacy museum tour, and a trip to the Whitney 
                        Plantation (one of the only plantation museums that focuses on the lives/experiences 
                        of the enslaved).

                        Being born there, Colorado has naturally been one of my favorite places in the world. 
                        Glenwood Springs is the home of my Aunt Jackie and her family - about an hour drive 
                        from my birthplace, Grand Junction.
                        As a kid, we visited yearly and it has always been a grounding place for me. 
                        Glenwood Springs is on the Western Slope - just west of 
                        Rocky Mountain National Park, it is a particularly beautiful area with panoramic 
                        scenery. The air is crisp, fresh, and dry - making it particularly uninhabitable by 
                        mosquitoes (another favorite feature). The place is brimming with outdoor adventure 
                        and craft beer - what’s not to like? A few of my favorite things to do there are drink 
                        beer, hike, ride a bicycle, play tennis, and spend time with family.

                        My partner, Brandon, and I took an epic trip from Las Vegas, NV (after seeing Celine Dion)
                        to Joshua Tree, California in March 2019. Joshua Tree is a National Park in the desert of 
                        California with such a dynamic landscape that it almost feels like you’re on a different 
                        planet. Spring was the ideal time to visit as it was during the superbloom (vivid wildflowers 
                        throughout the park due to winter rain). The town itself has a kind of old hippie/new hipster 
                        vibe with lots of vegan options and cold-brew coffee. It’s not really about the town though, 
                        as much as the landscape. My favorite part of the trip was probably our AirBnB in Morongo Valley 
                        - owned by a queer couple and filled with thoughtfully curated outdoor space, including a kitchen 
                        and hot tub.

                        Despite having a difficult time navigating a trip across Mexico and Central America with a friend,
                        San Cristóbal de las Casas stole my heart with its unapologetic charm. Considered the cultural capital 
                        of Chiapas, it has well preserved colonial buildings and markets with makers selling colorful textiles 
                        and goods throughout. The area’s history is rich with activism starting with liberation theology and 
                        transforming into the more militant - and very popular amongst leftists - Zapatista Movement started in 
                        the early 1990s. The area continues to be influenced by this movement and there are indigenous 
                        resistance ceremonies daily. Some of my favorite things about the area were wandering around and enjoying 
                        the dynamic charm of the area, drinking coffee at the euro-feeling cafe, going for a boat ride through the 
                        canyons, and exploring the deep history of resistance.

                        In 2016, one of Brandon’s closest childhood friends got married in Barcelona, Spain, so naturally we 
                        made a two week vacation out of it. My favorite of all of the places that we visited was Seville. 
                        Unlike its Catalonian counterpart, Barcelona, Seville is a place that is steeped in traditional Spanish 
                        culture, cuisine, and history. I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that chief among those for me is the 
                        cuisine. It is definitely the reason why Seville was my favorite spot. From more traditional tapas of 
                        meat, potatoes, and the occasional seafood, to their booming contemporary food scene, no meal was 
                        unimpressive. My personal favorite was the tuna tataki from a place called Mamarracha. In addition to 
                        the food, Seville is a great place to get lost amongst the beautiful gardens and palaces.

                        Bangkok holds a particularly special place in my heart. I studied abroad in Thailand from January - 
                        May 2008. The image above shows a more polished side of the city - one that the conservative government 
                        would like to present to the world. The reality of Bangkok is much more gritty and nuanced. I can only 
                        speak to my own experience of it, but it has a sort of “what happens in Bangkok…” feel to it. It’s a place
                         of indulgent escape for a lot of the world and there is a much more peaceful innocent side to it as well. 
                         The contrast of sex tourism and families living their day to day lives. Since I was 21 years old when I 
                         visited, my friends and I spent a lot of time out drinking in the bars, but mostly on the stoops of 7-11s. 
                         Most places, you can stand on the stoop of one 7-11 and throw your bottle cap to hit the stoop of another 
                         7-11. Other highlights - street food! The food served on the streets of Bangkok is better than most fine 
                         dining restaurants I’ve been to in other parts of the world.
